    Platform Parameters

Platform Parameters

These are parameters to configure IBAX. They are applicable to the blockchain network and all ecosystems within it.
Location to store platform parameters

Platform parameters are stored in the system_parameters table.

This table is located in the first (default) ecosystem created on the blockchain network.
Change of platform parameters

Change of platform parameters can only be made through voting. You can only use the UpdateSysParam contract to change any platform parameter, which is managed by definitions in the legal system of the platform.
