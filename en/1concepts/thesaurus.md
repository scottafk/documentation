Blockchain terms
Blockchain

    Blockchain is an information system that stores data and transmits and processes data within the system to prevent data from being forged or lost while maintaining data reliability; Data protection is achieved by:

            writing data into a blockchain of a series of encrypted blocks;
            distributed storage of blockchain copies in peer-to-peer networks;
            synchronization of blockchains on all nodes using a consensus mechanism;
            ensuring data reliability when performing data operations using the network with algorithms that store data transmissions and process contracts in the blockchain.

Peer-to-peer network

    A computer network, consisting of equally privileged nodes (without a central server).

Hash

    Also known as hashing, the binary value of any file or data set length that is mapped to a shorter fixed-length binary value.

Block

    After verifying the format and signature of the transaction, a transaction set is grouped by the honor node into a specific data structure. A block contains a hash pointer as a link to the previous block, which is one of the measures to ensure the security of blockchain encryption.

Block verification

    A procedure to verify the correctness of the block structure, generation time, compatibility with the previous block, transaction signatures, and the correspondence between the transaction and the block data.

Consensus

    The verification protocol or algorithm of this type of protocol used by the honor node in the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain.

Transaction

    Data transmission operations on the blockchain network or records of such transactions in the blockchain.

Token

    Proof of encrypted digital rights and shares that can be circulated on the blockchain. A set of identifiable digital records stored in a register, including a mechanism for exchanging rights and shares between these records.

Identification

    An encryption program used to identify users in the system.

Unique identification

    The process of linking accounts with users requires legal and organizational efforts or other procedures to achieve biometric identification in order to link user names with actual users.

Private key

    A string of characters secretly stored by its owner, used by the owner to access virtual accounts on the internet and sign transactions.

Public key

    A string of characters used to check the authenticity of the private key. The public key is uniquely derived from the private key.

Digital signature

    The attributes of a document or message obtained after encrypted data processing. The digital signature is used to check the integrity of the document (no modification) and authenticity (verification of the identity of the sender).

Smart contract

    In the program that performs data storage operations in the blockchain, all contracts are stored in the blockchain.

Transaction fee

    The fee paid to the honor node to execute the transaction.

Double spend

    A method of attacking the blockchain network. The result is that a transaction costs the same token twice. 

    This kind of attack occurs when the blockchain is forked, which can only be executed when the attacker controls more than 50% of the network's verification capability.

Encryption

    A way of digital data conversion, only the party with the corresponding decryption key can read it.

Private blockchain

    A blockchain network where all nodes and data access rights are centrally controlled by a single organization (government, company or individual).

Public blockchain

    In a blockchain network that is not controlled by any organization, all decisions are made by reaching a consensus among network participants. Everyone can obtain and access the data of the blockchain network.

Delegated Proof of Stake

    Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), a blockchain network consensus algorithm, the honor node is allocated by the owner of the token, and they use their own share of rights to vote.

IBAX terms
Testnet

    The version of the blockchain network used for testing.

Mainnet

    The main version of the blockchain network.

Transaction

    Call the contract and pass the parameters to the operation command of the contract. The result of the honor node execution is the update of the database.

Fuel

    A conventional unit used to calculate the cost of performing certain operations on a network of nodes. The fuel exchange rate is determined by a vote on the honor node.

Account address

    The data records store the token and can be accessed through a pair of keys (private key and public key).

Wallet address

    The character encoding identifier of the user on the node network that is used as the name of the user's virtual account.

Weaver

    The software client used to connect to the node network, which provides the desktop and web browser versions.

    Weaver integrates the platform development environment, including creating and editing tables, pages, and contracts. Users can build ecosystems, create and use applications in Weaver. 

Ecosystem

    A relatively closed or open software programming environment, including applications and ecosystem members.

    Ecosystem members can issue exclusive tokens belonging to the ecosystem, use smart contracts to establish interaction rules between members, and set access rights to application elements for members.

Ecosystem parameters

    A set of configurable ecosystem parameters, such as the account of the creator of the ecosystem and the permissions of changing application elements, can be changed in the parameter table.

Ecosystem members

    Users who can access specific ecosystems and application features.

Virtual private ecosystem

    Virtual private ecosystem - Cross Ledgers Base (CLB), which has the full set of functions of the standard ecosystem, but works outside the blockchain. In CLB, you can use and create contracts and template languages, database tables, and use Weaver to create applications. You can call contracts on the blockchain ecosystem via APIs.

Proof-of-Authority

    Proof-of-Authority (PoA) is a new consensus algorithm that provides high performance and fault tolerance. In PoA, the right to generate new blocks is granted to nodes that have proven the right to do so, and such nodes must be subject to preliminary verification.

V-Logic

    A scripting language used to create smart contracts that can handle data received from user pages and value operations performed in database tables.

    You can create and edit contracts in Weaver's editor.

V-Style

    The template language used to create pages. It can get values from database tables, build user pages, and pass user input data to the data section of the contract.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a set of software tools used to create applications.
